Problem:
	1.User can add several images to one drop zone.
	2.Images overlap each other and become undraggable.

Solution:
	 Need to check whether a drop zone already had a child before adding a child to it on drag.

Pathway:
	1) Go to the "zone.addEventListener("drop", function(e){})" function
	2) Use "zone.children.length" to check if a zone has a child
	3) "e.target.appendChild(document.querySelector(`#${draggedElement}`));" if the condition is true
	4) "console.log("Zone already has an element");" if the condition is false
