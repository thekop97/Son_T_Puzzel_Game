Problem:
	Images in drag zones are not deleted after user chooses a new background

Solution:
	1. Get images that are in drag zones, when user presses a button with new background.
	2. Append these images to the "puzzle-pieces" container

Pathway:
	1) Change"piecesBoard" from "const" to "let" to modify it later
	2) Create a new function "resetPuzzlePieces" that returns images in drag zones as an array "deletedImages"
	3) Go to "switchImage" function and append "deletedImages" to "piecesBoard"
